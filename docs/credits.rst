LSQ has been implemented in following languages:

- Python: `lsqpy <https://github.com/keegango/lsqpy>`_ by Keegan Go
- Julia: `LSQ.jl <https://github.com/davidlizeng/LSQ.jl>`_ by David Zeng and Karanveer Mohan
- Matlab: lsq by Alex Lemon

All implementations of LSQ are released under the MIT license.

The design of LSQ was inspired by Steven Diamond's
`CVXPY <http://cvxpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_,
a similar software packages for solving the much more general class of
convex optimization problems.

A huge thanks to Stephen Boyd for his feedback in both the design and
documentation of LSQ.
