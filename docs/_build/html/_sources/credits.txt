LLS has been implemented in following languages:

- Julia: `LinearLeastSquares.jl <https://github.com/davidlizeng/LinearLeastSquares.jl>`_ by David Zeng and Karanveer Mohan
- Python: `lsqpy <https://github.com/keegango/lsqpy>`_ by Keegan Go
- Matlab: lsq by Alex Lemon

All implementations of LLS are released under the MIT license.

The design of LLS was inspired by Steven Diamond's
`CVXPY <http://cvxpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_,
a similar software packages for solving the much more general class of
convex optimization problems.

A huge thanks to Stephen Boyd for his feedback in both the design and
documentation of LLS.
