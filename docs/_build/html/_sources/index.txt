Welcome to LSQ
==============
LSQ is a library that makes it easy to formulate and solve least squares
optimization problems with linear equality constraints. With LSQ, these types
of problems can be created using a natural syntax that mirrors standard
mathematical notation.

Credits
=======
LSQ has been implemented in following languages:

- Python: lsqpy by Keegan Go
- Julia: LSQ.jl by David Zeng and Karanveer Mohan
- Matlab: lsq by Alex Lemon

The design was inspired by Steven Diamond's CVXPY and Michael Grant's CVX,
similar software packages for solving the much more general class of
convex optimization problems.

A huge thanks to Stephen Boyd for his feedback in both the design and
documentation of LSQ.
