LinearLeastSquares.jl is a library that makes it easy to formulate and solve least-squares optimization problems with linear equality constraints. The full documentation for LinearLeastSquares can be found [here](http://lls.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)


LinearLeastSquares.jl's syntax and format are modelled on those of [Convex.jl] (https://github.com/cvxgrp/Convex.jl), a Julia package that handles the larger class of convex optimization problems.
